## Basic Creative Items & Block Activity Logger

A lightweight plugin that logs creative mode item movements and block placing/breaking with coordinates.  
All logs are saved in CSV files for easy review.

### Features
- Logs all item movements in creative mode (useful to detect item abuse like 64 dragon eggs).  
- Tracks block placing and breaking with exact coordinates.  
- Supports autoban setups by monitoring trap builds or suspicious activity.  
- Simple CSV output for easy parsing and external analysis.  
- Configurable via `config.yml` for customizing logging behavior.

### Usage
Ideal for servers wanting basic monitoring of creative abuse and griefing without heavy overhead or complex databases.
